<!-- Add your details -->

I am __Senthilkumar Subramanian__, a 29 year old data analytics trainee at Boston Consulting Group DigitalBCG Academy with ~5 years of experience in digital marketing and startups. My key achievements include generating over $60k in revenue for my startup, [Streaks n Strokes](https://www.streaksnstrokes.com/), in December 2019 and [pivoting the startup in the midst of Covid-19](https://www.streaksnstrokes.com/pages/our-story) to an ecommerce company.

I am currently doing a Mid-Career Pathways Programme in Data Analytics by Boston Consulting Group from March to August 2021, as I am __looking to pivot to a career in data analytics and/or digital marketing.__ The 2 key reasons I am looking to switch my career from startup founder to working in an organisation are

1.  I want to __grow my skills further in the areas of digital marketing and data analytics__, which I will be able to do best in a career in this field. 
2.  I am at a stage in my life where I __want more financial stability__, which a startup cannot provide. 

I am specifically looking for roles in digital marketing and data analytics, as I enjoy being in roles where I can play a significant part in driving the bottom line of the organisation. I also have real world experience in digital marketing, especially __Search Engine Optimisation__ and __Facebook paid advertising__, and undergone training in data analytics.
